//BUNDLERS

//React bundling involves the procedure of grouping and enhancing the source code of a
//React application and its associated components into one or more files to include in a web browser. 
//This bundling process is critical for enhancing the performance and reducing loading times of React applications.



//Using createElement is complex and causes errors when building a big structure .

//JSX??

//JSX => React.createElement => Object => HTML(DOM)
//Babel converts JSX to createElement .

const heading = (<h1 id="title" key="h3">
        Namaste React
    </h1>
);

//Babel understands JSX and not browser .

//Babel is a JavaScript compilerâ€‹
//Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a 
//backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

//Is JSX == HTML inside JavaScript ? NO
//HTML and JSX are look-alikes but not the same thing .
//Javascript only uses CamelCase .
