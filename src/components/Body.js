//  Optional Chaining ?.



//  props = properties .
//  props are passed as arguments in the functional component on their own .

//  JSX curly braces do support embedding JavaScript expressions, 
//  but they do not support JavaScript statements like for loops directly. 
//  JavaScript expressions return a value, whereas statements perform an action. Hereâ€™s the difference:

//  Expressions are things like 2 + 2, myArray.map(...), or restaurant.name.
//  Statements are things like if conditions, for loops, and while loops.


//  ONE WAY DATA-BINDING

//  React uses one-way data binding .


//  What is State ?
//  What is Hook ? -functions
//  What is useState ?

//useState is a hook .


//MicroServices ?
//We have small projects for every small component (UI , API , Notifications , Logs , Authentication) .
//And every component (small project) can run on different ports and can have different databases that they rely on .

//How these are connected ?
//All the ports are mapped to eachother and in majority cases have the same domain name .

//Seperation of concern (SOC) .

//Monolith ?

//Two ways to integrate APIs :
    //1. As soon as the user reloads(lif 200ms) the page call API(if 300ms) .
    //The page will take 500 ms to render .

    //2. As soon as user loads the page , 
    //show user something on the page then call API the update UI .
