//JSX curly braces do support embedding JavaScript expressions, 
//but they do not support JavaScript statements like for loops directly. 
//JavaScript expressions return a value, whereas statements perform an action. Hereâ€™s the difference:

//Expressions are things like 2 + 2, myArray.map(...), or restaurant.name.
//Statements are things like if conditions, for loops, and while loops.


//ONE WAY DATA-BINDING

//React uses one-way data binding .
